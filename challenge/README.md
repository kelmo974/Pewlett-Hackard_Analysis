# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis


### Overview
Pewlett-Hackard has been presented with what they are calling the 'silver tsunami' as a generation of employees ages out of the workforce. The timing of this is set to leave the company with a sizeable HR task to fill these roles. Will they need to bring in thousands of outside hires? Do they have the numbers within for junior ranks to fill this labor void? 

PostgresSQL (pgAdmin 4) was used to determine how many employees a given department will need to replace and identify those that qualify for a mentorship program as part of this transitional period. In order to do so, a slew of tables holding linkable data were emplyed to categorize and count these employees with the hopes that this analysis would shine the light on a path forward for Pewlett-Hackard.

### Results

* Senior Engineers will be the single greatest group of staff members to replace with nearly 26000 individuals

* 1940 employees qualify for the mentorship program - this is only approximately 2% of the individuals needed to fill all the positions set to be opening during the 'silver tsunami'. 

* Suprisingly, management is slated for the least positions to fill - just two.

* High attrition will also be experienced at the Senior Staff, Engineer, and Staff levels

### Summary

1.How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

A total of 72458 roles will eventually need to be filled. 

2.Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

No, the mentorship program count is substantially less than the total number of roles to fill. A potential 1940 fills out of the 72458 total vacancies are represetned in the mentorship program.
